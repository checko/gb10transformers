# Test Review Directory

This directory contains test cases for the AI Code Reviewer (`codereview.py`).

## File Structure and Naming Conventions

*   **Original Source Files** (e.g., `bad_cpp.cpp`): Clean source files containing intentional bugs (memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, etc.) used as input for the reviewer.
*   **Answer Keys** (`*_a`): The original source files containing embedded comments marking the expected issues. These serve as the "ground truth" or answer key.
*   **Review Results** (`*_r`): The output files generated by `codereview.py`. These contain the AI-generated review comments.

## Usage

To run the tests and generate new `*_r` files:

```bash
./run_review.sh test_review
```

Compare the generated `*_r` files with the `*_a` answer keys to verify the model's performance.
